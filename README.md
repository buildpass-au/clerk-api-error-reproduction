## Clerk Dev Environment Issue

Weâ€™re facing an issue with Clerk in Dev Environment. The strange part is that it only happens in Dev, while everything works fine in Production.

Here's the error:

```{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Browser unauthenticated",
            "long_message": "Unable to authenticate this browser for your development instance. Check your Clerk cookies and try again. If the issue persists, reach out to support@clerk.com.",
            "code": "dev_browser_unauthenticated"
        }
    ],
    "clerk_trace_id": "7f0cb5d117cb4eac112d7c46bb9e429e"
}
```

### Pages

- Public: "/" `(This is where the Clerk API errors happens)`
- Admin: "/admin"

## Running the template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-pages-quickstart
```

To run the example locally, you need to:

1. Set the required Clerk environment variables as shown in [the example `env.local.example` file](./.env.local.example).

2. `npm install` the required dependencies.

3. `npm run dev` to launch the development server.
